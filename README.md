# LEGAL-Named-Entity-Recognition
This project focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Indian court judgments, aiming to develop an NLP system to identify entities in legal texts. Using machine learning, especially LUKE-large, the system improves accuracy and efficiency in information extraction, outperforming previous models based on metrics like F1-score.
